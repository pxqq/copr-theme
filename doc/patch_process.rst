Patch process
=============

So you'd like to send in a patch to Copr?  Great!


First, get the code: :ref:`downloads`


Then read the git instructions on the :ref:`git_guide`. You'll want to send in a patch via `git-format-patch1` to the Developer mailing list (see :ref:`communication`).


As mentioned on the other page, patches should be applied to HEAD in git, and we'll take care of applying them to other releases as appropriate.


If you send some (aprox. 10) patches which will have no issues, you may get direct write access to copr.git.
